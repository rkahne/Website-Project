Code Lousville Project

I graduated from the Front End Development Track of Code Lousiville.  As a part of that program, we had to do a project.

This project utilizes the Reddit API to search for related subreddits, users, and posts that are related to a search term.
The website is styled using Bootstrap and is written in Javascript.  It utilizes JQuery and underscore.

Here is the video where I explain the project and how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfFElEA5_AU&index=36&list=PLKFlVlvK_fALmJ2QLM9PxOMb3qTubclsz
